Your freshly baked project is ready. Next, you may want to setup integrations:

 * AppVeyor and Travis CI for continuous integration
   * Travis CI: set environment variables, like: GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN / LT_RELEASE_UPLOAD_*
 * codecov.io for coverage reports
 * codeclimate: add repo on https://codeclimate.com/oss/dashboard and
   https://github.com/organizations/LiberTEM/settings/installations/6617132
   then enable "pull request status updates" (see github settings on codeclimate.com)

You will also want to adjust some files, like

 * .github/* - github config like PR templates etc.
