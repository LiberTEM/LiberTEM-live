Installation
============

.. note::

    We currently support Python 3.11 to 3.14, and have tested LiberTEM-live
    on Linux, Windows and Mac OS systems. Please see the individual
    :ref:`detector documentation <detectors>` for more details on
    system requirements.

The short version to install into an existing environment,
which already has LiberTEM v0.11+ installed:

.. code-block:: shell

    (libertem) $ python -m pip install "libertem-live"

If you don't have such an environment, please see
the `LiberTEM installation instructions
<https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/install.html>`_ for more details.
