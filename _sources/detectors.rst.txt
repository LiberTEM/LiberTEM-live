Supported Detectors
===================

These are the different detectors and detector APIs supported in LiberTEM-live. Note
that level of support can vary between these, but the basic functionality
of receiving data and running UDFs on it works for each of these.

Support for additional detectors is planned, please talk to us if you are
missing your detector in this list!

In addition, there is also a :ref:`memory "detector" <memory detector>` available,
which is mostly useful for testing, and is not optimized for production use.
